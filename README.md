<p>This is a freelance developer's portfolio that I found about a year ago. I was so impressed with it, however, that I remembered it and figured I should share it with the class.
It's so impressive because I can't imagine how the developer was able to enable the website to function in this way. The execution is really good, the design is great, and it is an all-around fun website to explore.</p><p>
I realize this isn't exactly an article like the instructions asked, but I figured this would be something unique that others would probably enjoy looking at as well.</p>

I also **highly** recommend checking out this developer's other works in his [github](https://github.com/brunosimon/). He makes a ton of physics-based work that I think is really cool.

Comment from **Alex**: WOW this website is amazing! This is such a fun way to explore your portfolio site and also showcase the front-end building skills the author has. I wonder in what language or framework this was written?
